## Monster Kingdom: Quest for Gold
Monster Kingdom: Quest for Gold is a game in which the user's goal is to collect as many pots of gold (worth 500 points) 
and pieces of candy (worth 100 points) as possible. The catch is the user must dodge monsters, which cost the user one life,
and dynamite, which--if run into--will cause the game to end, regardless of how many lives are left. A moving wall also 
creates an obstacle for the player. The goal of the game is to collect the most amount of points before the user's lives run out
or the game is terminated by running into dynamite.

You can also write in **bold** or _italics_. You can also ~~strike through~~ or write inline `Code Segments`

>Blockquotes are done as such.

Just make sure to separate paragraphs with an emptyline. 
Otherwise, they are considered in the same paragraph.

You link to [Google](https://www.google.com) as such and lists are written has follows:
  1. First you indent with two empty spaces.
  1. Then, you use:
    * `1.` to signal an ordered (i.e. numbered) list, or
    * `*`, `-`, `+` to represent an unordered list.
      1. Make sure to maintain indentation
      1. As it is used to identify sub-lists
  1. Numbering and symboles don't matter as they are auto-generated later.

Tables are pretty easy to make:

| Tables        | Are           | Easy          |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -------------:|
| left-aligned  | centered      | right-aligned |
| header are    | bolded and    | centered      |
| zebra stripes | are neat      | 1             |


Images are added inline by using the following syntax
